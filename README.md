# MojRozvrhFE

MojRozvrh is a project developed for UMB, using Angular on the frontend and Spring Boot on the backend. This application serves as a timetable.

# Key Technologies and Dependencies

- **Angular 17.2.0**: A platform for building web applications. Angular includes a wealth of essential features such as mobile gestures, animations, filtering, routing, data binding, security, internationalization, and beautiful UI components. It's extremely modular, lightweight, and easy to learn.

- **Syncfusion**: A comprehensive suite of over 1,600 components and frameworks for web, mobile, and desktop development. Syncfusion can significantly cut down development time and is adaptable to a wide variety of business needs.

- **Tailwind CSS**: A highly customizable, low-level CSS framework that gives you all of the building blocks you need to build bespoke designs without any annoying opinionated styles you have to fight to override.

- **RXJS**: A library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs by using observable sequences. It provides one core type, the Observable, satellite types (Observer, Schedulers, Subjects) and operators inspired by Array#extras (map, filter, reduce, every, etc) to allow handling asynchronous events as collections.
